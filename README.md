The increasing digitalization of healthcare has raised significant concerns about the privacy and security of personal health data. As individuals become more aware of how their healthcare information is collected, stored, and shared, questions regarding data ownership, access, and security have come to the forefront. This web-based tool designed to help users assess the privacy and ethical risks associated with sharing personal healthcare data. The tool focuses on four primary areas: genetic testing, electronic health records (EHRs), health insurance discrimination, and legal data sharing. By offering a simple, user-friendly quiz, the tool generates a personalized risk report that provides individuals with an understanding of their potential vulnerabilities.
